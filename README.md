  <h4>A cool Rock, Paper and Scissors game written in Go.</h4>

This is the first something I've done in GO, and I like it both. I hope my language-hopping stop here so I can finally learn a technology for real and get a job 🙂

This project is not something to put on my resume, just something to mark the start of my Go journey.
